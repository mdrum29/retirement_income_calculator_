ABOUT

1. The Retirement Income Calculator (RIC) creates a monte carlo normal distribution of returns based on historical returns and standard deviations for the overall stock and bond markets.
2. The RIC returns a most likely retirement balance (median) and a best case/worst case range (75th, 25th percentiles)
3. Finally, the RIC returns the largest amount that can be withdrawn per month in retirement without running out of money.
